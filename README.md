   Introduction

The E-commerce Backend API allows developers to build and integrate e-commerce functionalities into their applications. It provides a set of endpoints to manage products, users, orders, and payments.

The API follows RESTful principles and uses JSON for data representation. It supports standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Responses are returned with appropriate HTTP status codes and include JSON payloads.

Authentication

Authentication is required to access protected endpoints. The API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. To authenticate, include the JWT token in the Authorization header of each request.

Example:

makefile
Copy code
Authorization: Bearer <JWT token>
To obtain a JWT token, make a POST request to the /auth/login endpoint with valid credentials.

Error Handling

The API follows a consistent error handling approach. Errors are returned with appropriate HTTP status codes and include an error message in the response body.

Example error response:

css
Copy code
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json

{
"error": "Invalid request parameters."
}
